When building a personalized AI model platform that supports different types of sign-ups for executive-level users like CEOs, CFOs, and other members, your sign-up types (or user roles) should be designed with clarity, security, and personalization in mind.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of sign-up types (user roles) you might define, along with how a personalized AI model could tailor itself to each:

üîπ Suggested Sign-Up Types for Executive Users

Department/industry context

Access level and data sensitivity

Behind the Scenes (Model Adaptation):

Assign different prompts, dashboards, data connectors, or training contexts based on role

Define what kinds of alerts, summaries, or decision support are generated
